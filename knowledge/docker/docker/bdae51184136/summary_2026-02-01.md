The log entries indicate that there is a persistent issue with the Prisma client trying to query non-existent tables (`public.logs` and `public.incidents`). This suggests that either:

1. The database schema has not been updated properly, or
2. There's an issue in how your application is connecting to the database.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### 1. Verify Your Database Schema

Ensure that the `public.logs` and `public.incidents` tables exist in your database. You can do this by running SQL commands or using a database management tool like `pgAdmin`, `DBeaver`, or the command line.

```sql
-- Check for public.logs table
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'logs';

-- Check for public.incidents table
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'incidents';
```

### 2. Verify Your Prisma Schema

Ensure that your `prisma/schema.prisma` file correctly defines the models corresponding to these tables.

```prisma
model Log {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  timestamp DateTime @map("timestamp")
  message   String
}

model Incident {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  severity   String
  summary    String
  detail     JSON
}
```

### 3. Update Prisma Migrations

If you are using Prisma migrations, make sure that your database schema has been updated properly.

1. Generate a new migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_logs_table
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_incidents_table
```

2. Apply the migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate save --experimental && npx prisma migrate up --experimental
```

### 4. Check Your Prisma Client

Ensure that your TypeScript types for `Log` and `Incident` are correctly defined.

```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const prisma = new PrismaClient()

async function main() {
    // Example queries
    const logs = await prisma.log.findMany()
    console.log(logs)
    
    const incidents = await prisma.incident.findMany()
    console.log(incidents)
}

main()
  .catch(e => {
    throw e
  })
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect()
  })
```

### 5. Check Database Connection

Ensure that your database connection settings are correct in `prisma.config` or `env`.

```javascript
// prisma.config.js or .env file
PRISMA_ENDPOINT="your-database-url-here"
PRISMA_SECRET="your-db-secret-here"
```

### 6. Restart Your Application

Sometimes, restarting your application can resolve transient issues.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the missing tables in your database. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your setup (e.g., Prisma version, database type, etc.).
