### Log Summary

#### Key Events:
- Backend starts successfully.
- Log collector and incident detector are initialized and started.
- Periodic collection of Docker container facts and log updates.

#### Errors & Patterns:
- **Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'map')`
  - This error occurs in the `/app/dist/adapters/docker.js` file, specifically at lines 30 and 38. It suggests that a variable intended to hold an array is unexpectedly `null`.
  - The pattern shows this error recurring every 5-10 seconds.

#### Patterns:
- **Facts Collection:** 
  - Regularly collects Docker container facts (9 per collection) and stores them in the database.
  - Logs from multiple containers are being monitored and stored.
  
- **Log Detection:**
  - The Log Collector detects new logs for `wingman-backend-1` at a consistent rate of 3-4 logs every minute.

#### Root Causes:
- **Potential Issue with Docker Adapter:** 
  - The error points to an issue within the Docker adapter where it's attempting to map over a null object. This might be due to incorrect handling of Docker API responses or a misconfiguration in how containers are listed and accessed.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Review Docker Adapter Code:**
   - Inspect lines 30-38 in `/app/dist/adapters/docker.js` for potential issues with null checks.
2. **Check Docker Service Status:** 
   - Ensure that the Docker service is running correctly and that the adapter can properly interact with it.
3. **Update Error Handling:** 
   - Add robust error handling to manage cases where a container list might be `null`.

### Restart Analysis:
- A restart action was executed on `docker://745f3df6bab9` due to detected incidents, indicating that the system is capable of responding to certain types of failures.

This summary should help in identifying and resolving the root cause of the recurring errors.
