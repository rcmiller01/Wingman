The logs you provided indicate that PostgreSQL is running and has encountered some issues related to database recovery. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Initialization and Recovery**:
   - The PostgreSQL server was initialized from an existing database directory, as evidenced by the message "PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database; Skipping initialization".
   - During startup, the server attempted automatic recovery due to the system being interrupted, as seen in the logs.

2. **Recovery Process**:
   - The server logged issues during recovery, such as invalid record length errors and the start of checkpoint operations for recovery.
   - After completing recovery, the server reported that it was ready to accept connections.

3. **Checkpoints and Recovery Logs**:
   - Multiple checkpoint events were recorded at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
   - These checkpoints include details such as the number of buffers written, time taken for sync operations, and estimated distances.

4. **Connection Issues**:
   - There was an "could not receive data from client: Connection reset by peer" log entry, indicating a potential network issue or client disconnection during a command execution.
   
5. **Errors Related to Tables**:
   - Frequent errors such as "relation 'public.incidents' does not exist at character 321" indicate that the necessary tables (`incidents`) are missing in your database schema.

### Recommendations:

- **Verify Table Existence**: Ensure that the `incidents` table exists and is correctly defined in your PostgreSQL schema. You can check this by running:
  ```sql
  \d incidents
  ```
  or
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM incidents LIMIT 0;
  ```

- **Check Database Schema**: Make sure the database schema matches what you expect, especially if it has been modified or restored from a backup. You can use tools like `pg_dump` and `psql` to manage your schemas.

- **Database Backup and Restore**: If there was an issue with the original data or schema, consider restoring from a known good backup.

- **Network Stability**: Ensure that network connections are stable between the client and PostgreSQL server. The "Connection reset by peer" error could be due to temporary disconnections during queries.

- **PostgreSQL Logs**: Keep detailed logs for future reference in case of similar issues. Adjust your `postgresql.conf` settings if necessary, such as increasing logging levels or adjusting buffer sizes.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the immediate issues and ensure that PostgreSQL operates smoothly.
