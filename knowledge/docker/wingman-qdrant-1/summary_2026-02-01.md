### Log Summary

**Timestamps and Application Version:** 
- Logs indicate the application version is `1.16.3` with build `bd49f45a`.

**Startup Events:**
- The application starts twice, on 2026-02-01T02:20:46Z and 18:28:39Z.
- Both instances display the same initial information and configuration details.

**Key Events & Patterns:**
- **Loading Raft State:** The application loads its state from `./storage/raft_state.json` at both startup times.
- **Distributed Mode Disabled:** Distributed mode is explicitly disabled during both startups.
- **Telemetry Enabled:** Telemetry reporting is enabled with different IDs for each startup.

**API Listening:**
- Both instances start listening on `6333` for HTTP API and `6334` for gRPC API, with TLS disabled for both.
- Actix runtime starts 15 workers in both cases.

### Root Causes & Patterns

- **No Errors or Crashes:** There are no error messages or crashes noted in the logs.
- **Repeated Startup Events:** The application appears to restart twice at different times of the day. This could indicate a periodic restart strategy, possibly for maintenance or to clear temporary states.
- **Consistent Configuration:** Configurations such as distributed mode and telemetry settings remain consistent across both startups.

### Recommendations
1. **Monitor Application Health:** Ensure that the repeated startup is intended and necessary by monitoring application health metrics.
2. **Logging & Monitoring:** Consider adding more detailed logging around state loading and worker initialization to catch any issues early.
3. **Configuration Management:** If periodic restarts are required, ensure they do not disrupt user sessions or service availability.

Overall, the logs indicate a smooth startup process with no critical errors, but further investigation into the reasons for repeated startups might be beneficial.
