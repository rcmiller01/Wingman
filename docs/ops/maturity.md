# Operational Maturity Ladder

Use this ladder to set expectations and avoid scope creep as you scale.

## Tier 0 — Read-only Monitoring + Incidents

- Dashboards, alerts, and incident narratives.
- No automated changes.

## Tier 1 — Guided Runbooks (Skills)

- Human-in-the-loop runbooks and procedural guidance.
- Emphasis on repeatability and documentation.

## Tier 2 — Generate IaC (OpenTofu/Ansible)

- Wingman proposes infrastructure-as-code changes.
- You review and apply outside the system.

## Tier 3 — Optional Execution

- Explicit opt-in execution, with audits and approvals.
- Default remains non-autonomous.
