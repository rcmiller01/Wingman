# Unit 7 — Runbooks, Style Guide, and Governance

**Objective:** Institutionalize narrative quality and change control.
**Depends on:** Units 0–6

## Implementation TODO

- [ ] Publish narrative style guide (confidence + uncertainty language).
- [ ] Publish runbook to trace claims back to evidence.
- [ ] Define ownership + review cadence for semantic rule changes.
- [ ] Require governance checklist for semantics updates.

## Evidence required

- [ ] Style guide doc
- [ ] Debugging runbook
- [ ] Governance checklist template

## Verification checklist

- [ ] On-call can trace each headline/claim to evidence.
- [ ] Semantic changes require explicit review sign-off.
