# Unit 2 — Narrative Composer Service

**Objective:** Generate canonical narrative contract payloads.
**Depends on:** Unit 1

## Implementation TODO

- [ ] Build composer for all v1 contract fields.
- [ ] Implement deterministic headline templating.
- [ ] Enforce confidence wording bands from Unit 0.
- [ ] Require evidence links for each surfaced claim.
- [ ] Add validation for missing/orphan/contradictory fields.

## Evidence required

- [ ] Composer module + schema validation
- [ ] Golden input/output fixtures
- [ ] Claim-to-evidence mapping examples

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Same aggregate input yields same narrative output.
- [ ] `overall_status` and headline are channel-agnostic and stable.
